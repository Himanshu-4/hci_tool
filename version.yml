# YAML file rules

# YML parser rule

#  parser will work in step by step its only job is to decode the and resolve the all YAML files into dic and store it for lateral use


# 1.parser will first validate the file and then it look for any include symbol and then resolve 
# - parser will first resolve the file inclusion to process the include files and expand it into a temporary file 
# - if any error encounter raise the exception 
# - again in that file it searchs for include symbol
# - include inside the key are ignored by the parser 

# 2. then it expand the expression and create a database for the expression then it expands the expressions

# 3. run a format checker for checking unwanted include files that are not in global scope and expression that are not yet resolved and other things like not value for a key, etc

# 4. store the whole database inside its memory and expose api to use that 

# multiple files are created in that part and parser will create inside its folder in app_data
